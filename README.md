This is my Course Project 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis course on Coursera.

Here are 4 PNG files and 4 .R files which refer to the corresponding plot tasks respectively.

The PNG files was contained in **pictures** directory, while the .R files were involved in **source** directory.

All the .R files did NOT contain setting working directory, thus you should navigate the working directory to where the dataset locates in before running these scripts.
